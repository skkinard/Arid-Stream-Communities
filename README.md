# Arid-Stream-Communities
Characterizing subtropical stream fish and macroinvertebrate communities along a natural aridity gradient

Applied statistics:
Regression, principle coordinate analysis, multiple regression, redundancy analysis, diversity estimation

Summary:
Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increase the aridity of many regions of the world. Surface water ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to changes in the water-cycle and may suffer adverse impacts in affected regions. To enhance our understanding of how freshwater communities will respond to predicted shifts in water-cycle dynamics, we employed a space for time approach along a natural precipitation gradient on the Texas Coastal Prairie. In the Spring of 2017, we conducted surveys of 10 USGS-gauged, wadeable streams spanning a semi-arid to sub-humid rainfall gradient; we measured nutrients, water chemistry, habitat characteristics, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish communities. Fish diversity correlated positively with precipitation and was negatively correlated with conductivity. Macroinvertebrate diversity peaked within the middle of the gradient. Semi-arid fish and invertebrate communities were dominated by euryhaline and live-bearing taxa. Sub-humid communities contained environmentally sensitive trichopterans and ephemeropterans as well as a variety of predatory fish which may impose top-down controls on primary consumers. These results warn that aridification coincides with the loss of competitive and environmentally sensitive taxa which could yield less desirable community states.

- data_files contain data and outputs
- r_scripts contain calculations
- r_source_files contain helper functions

Warning: this is my first major application of R analyses. So scripts are in need of edits. Scripts are highly specific for the data provided. The formal results and additional details can be found in the published manuscript at PeerJ (https://peerj.com/articles/12137/).
